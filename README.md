## Data Scraping

The data was scraped from the Election Commission of India's website using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. The scraping process involved extracting the following information:

1. **State-wise Voting Data**:
    - State Name
    - Parliament Constituency
    - Winning Candidate
    - Total Votes
    - Margin
    - Party Name

2. **Party-wise Performance**:
    - Party Name
    - Won
    - Leading
    - Total Seats

Here is a sample code snippet to scrape the data:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://results.eci.gov.in'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Extract data (this is an example and might need adjustment based on the actual website structure)
state_data = []
for option in soup.find(id='ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_Result1_ddlState').find_all('option'):
    state_data.append(option.text)

# Continue scraping the required details and store them in pandas DataFrame
```
